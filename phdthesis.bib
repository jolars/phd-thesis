    In many multivariate situations we are presented with more variables than we would
    like, and the question arises whether they are all necessary and if not which can
    be discarded. In this paper we consider two such situations.(a)Regression analysis.
    The problem here is whether any variables can be discarded as adding little or
    nothing to the accuracy with which the regression equation correlates with the
    dependent variable.(b)Interdependence analysis. The problem is whether a
    constellation in p dimonsions collapses, exactly or approximately, into fewer
    dimensions, and if so whether any of the original variables can be discarded.We may
    define the best solution to (a) using any given number of variables as the one that
    maximizes the multiple correlation between the selected variables and the dependent
    variable, and similarly for (b) as the one that maximizes the smallest multiple
    correlation with any of the rejected variables. In practice it is usual to accept
    an approximate solution to (a) based on `step-wise' multiple regression: we know of
    no standard program for (b). We have developed cut-off rules that enable us to find
    the best solution to both problems by partial enumeration. The paper discusses the
    details of this approach, and computational experience.

    We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms (ISTA) for
    solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of
    methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm,
    is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale
    problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to
    converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative
    shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational
    simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be
    significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising
    numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities
    of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.

    We propose a pivotal method for estimating high-dimensional sparse linear
    regression models, where the overall number of regressors p is large, possibly much
    larger than n, but only s regressors are significant. The method is a modification
    of the lasso, called the square-root lasso. The method is pivotal in that it
    neither relies on the knowledge of the standard deviation \ensuremath{\sigma} nor
    does it need to pre-estimate \ensuremath{\sigma}. Moreover, the method does not
    rely on normality or sub-Gaussianity of noise. It achieves near-oracle performance,
    attaining the convergence rate \ensuremath{\sigma}\{(s/n) log p\}1/2 in the
    prediction norm, and thus matching the performance of the lasso with known
    \ensuremath{\sigma}. These performance results are valid for both Gaussian and
    non-Gaussian errors, under some mild moment restrictions. We formulate the
    square-root lasso as a solution to a convex conic programming problem, which allows
    us to implement the estimator using efficient algorithmic methods, such as
    interior-point and first-order methods.

    Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks
    have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel
    approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has
    been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a
    few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it
    possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better
    results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training
    neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using
    random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected
    improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient
    for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for
    training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN
    learning problems from [Larochelle et al., 2007] and find significantly better
    results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques
    for making response surface models P (y\vert{}x) in which many elements of
    hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values
    of other elements.

    Setting regularization parameters for Lasso-type estimators is notoriously
    difficult, though crucial for obtaining the best accuracy. The most popular
    hyperparameter optimization approach is grid-search on a held-out dataset. However,
    grid-search requires to choose a predefined grid of parameters and scales
    exponentially in the number of parameters. Another class of approaches casts
    hyperparameter optimization as a bi-level optimization problem, typically solved by
    gradient descent. The key challenge for these approaches is the estimation of the
    gradient w.r.t. the hyperparameters. Computing that gradient via forward or
    backward automatic differentiation usually suffers from high memory consumption,
    while implicit differentiation typically involves solving a linear system which can
    be prohibitive and numerically unstable. In addition, implicit differentiation
    usually assumes smooth loss functions, which is not the case of Lasso-type
    problems. This work introduces an efficient implicit differentiation algorithm,
    without matrix inversion, tailored for Lasso-type problems. Our proposal scales to
    high-dimensional data by leveraging the sparsity of the solutions. Empirically, we
    demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a large number of standard methods
    for hyperparameter optimization.

    Finding the optimal hyperparameters of a model can be cast as a bilevel

    study first-order methods when the inner optimization problem is convex but
    non-smooth. We show that the forward-mode differentiation of proximal gradient

    Finally, we provide a bound on the error made on the hypergradient when the inner

    We introduce a novel method for sparse regression and variable selection, which is
    inspired by modern ideas in multiple testing. Imagine we have observations from the
    linear model y = X beta + z, then we suggest estimating the regression coefficients
    by means of a new estimator called SLOPE, which is the solution to minimize 0.5
    \vert{}\vert{}y - Xb\textbackslash \vert{}\_2\textasciicircum 2 + lambda\_1
    \vert{}b\vert{}\_(1) + lambda\_2 \vert{}b\vert{}\_(2) + ... + lambda\_p
    \vert{}b\vert{}\_(p); here, lambda\_1 {$>$}= \textbackslash lambda\_2 {\$>\$}= ...
    {\$>\$}= \textbackslash lambda\_p {\$>\$}= 0 and \vert{}b\vert{}\_(1) {\$>\$}=
    \vert{}b\vert{}\_(2) {\$>\$}= ... {\$>\$}= \vert{}b\vert{}\_(p) is the order
    statistic of the magnitudes of b. The regularizer is a sorted L1 norm which
    penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank,
    the larger the penalty. This is similar to the famous BHq procedure [Benjamini and
    Hochberg, 1995], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a family
    to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. SLOPE is a convex
    program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the solution. We
    prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking lambda\_i =
    F\textasciicircum\{-1\}(1-q\_i) (F is the cdf of the errors), q\_i = iq/(2p),
    controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. When the design
    matrix is nonorthogonal there are inherent limitations on the FDR level and the
    power which can be obtained with model selection methods based on L1-like
    penalties. However, whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly
    correlated, we demonstrate empirically that it is possible to select the parameters
    lambda\_i as to obtain FDR control at a reasonable level as long as the number of
    nonzero coefficients is not too large. At the same time, the procedure exhibits
    increased power over the lasso, which treats all coefficients equally. The paper
    illustrates further estimation properties of the new selection rule through
    comprehensive simulation studies.

    LASSO and SLOPE are two popular methods for dimensionality reduction in the
    high-dimensional regression. LASSO can eliminate redundant predictors by setting
    the corresponding regression coefficients to zero, while SLOPE can additionally
    identify clusters of variables with the same absolute values of regression
    coefficients. It is well known that LASSO Irrepresentability Condition is
    sufficient and necessary for the proper estimation of the sign of sufficiently
    large regression coefficients. In this article we formulate an analogous
    Irrepresentability Condition for SLOPE, which is sufficient and necessary for the
    proper identification of the SLOPE pattern, i.e. of the proper sign as well as of
    the proper ranking of the absolute values of individual regression coefficients,
    while proper ranking guarantees a proper clustering. We also provide asymptotic
    results on the strong consistency of pattern recovery by SLOPE when the number of
    columns in the design matrix is fixed while the sample size diverges to infinity.

    Variable selection can be challenging, particularly in situations with a large
    number of predictors with possibly high correlations, such as gene expression data.
    In this article, a new method called the OSCAR (octagonal shrinkage and clustering
    algorithm for regression) is proposed to simultaneously select variables while
    grouping them into predictive clusters. In addition to improving prediction
    accuracy and interpretation, these resulting groups can then be investigated
    further to discover what contributes to the group having a similar behavior. The
    technique is based on penalized least squares with a geometrically intuitive
    penalty function that shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero. Additionally, this
    penalty yields exact equality of some coefficients, encouraging correlated
    predictors that have a similar effect on the response to form predictive clusters
    represented by a single coefficient. The proposed procedure is shown to compare
    favorably to the existing shrinkage and variable selection techniques in terms of
    both prediction error and model complexity, while yielding the additional grouping
    information.

    setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a
    posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation
    to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration
    (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely
    to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present two
    detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments---active user
    modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning---and a

    procedure, which allows for adaptive selection of regressors under sparse
    high-dimensional designs. Here, we extend the idea of SLOPE to deal with the
    situation when one aims at selecting whole groups of explanatory variables instead
    of single regressors. Such groups can be formed by clustering strongly correlated
    predictors or groups of dummy variables corresponding to different levels of the
    same qualitative predictor. We formulate the respective convex optimization
    problem, group SLOPE (gSLOPE), and propose an efficient algorithm for its solution.
    We also define a notion of the group false discovery rate (gFDR) and provide a
    choice of the sequence of tuning parameters for gSLOPE so that gFDR is provably
    controlled at a prespecified level if the groups of variables are orthogonal to
    each other. Moreover, we prove that the resulting procedure adapts to unknown
    sparsity and is asymptotically minimax with respect to the estimation of the
    proportions of variance of the response variable explained by regressors from
    different groups. We also provide a method for the choice of the regularizing
    sequence when variables in different groups are not orthogonal but statistically
    independent and illustrate its good properties with computer simulations. Finally,
    we illustrate the advantages of gSLOPE in the context of Genome Wide Association
    Studies. R package grpSLOPE with an implementation of our method is available on
    The Comprehensive R Archive Network.

    The time-frequency and time-scale communities have recently developed a large
    number of overcomplete waveform dictionaries---stationary wavelets, wavelet
    packets, cosine packets, chirplets, and warplets, to name a few. Decomposition into
    overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been
    proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), matching pursuit (MP), and, for
    special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB).Basis pursuit (BP) is a
    principle for decomposing a signal into an "optimal"' superposition of dictionary
    elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coefficients among all
    such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP,
    and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting
    relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, abstract harmonic
    analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising.BP in highly
    overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals
    of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear
    program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only
    because of recent advances in linear and quadratic programming by interior-point
    methods. We obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method
    and conjugate-gradient solver.

    With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to
    adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise
    polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown
    function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over
    traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori
    unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data
    alone. We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective
    wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and
    piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are
    not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an
    oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, RiskShrink, which works
    by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. RiskShrink used in connection with
    sample rotation. Inclusion probabilities of any order can be written explicitly in
    closed form. Second-order inclusion probabilities \ensuremath{\pi}ij satisfy the
    condition \$0 {$<\$} \textbackslash pi\_\{ij\} {\$<\$} \textbackslash
    pi\_\{i\}\textbackslash pi\_j\$, which guarantees Yates \& Grundy's variance
    estimator to be unbiased, definable for all samples and always nonnegative for any

    We attempt to recover a function of unknown smoothness from noisy sampled data. We
    introduce a procedure, SureShrink, that suppresses noise by thresholding the
    empirical wavelet coefficients. The thresholding is adaptive: A threshold level is
    assigned to each dyadic resolution level by the principle of minimizing the Stein
    unbiased estimate of risk (Sure) for threshold estimates. The computational effort
    of the overall procedure is order N \cdot{} log(N) as a function of the sample size
    N. SureShrink is smoothness adaptive: If the unknown function contains jumps, then
    the reconstruction (essentially) does also; if the unknown function has a smooth
    piece, then the reconstruction is (essentially) as smooth as the mother wavelet
    will allow. The procedure is in a sense optimally smoothness adaptive: It is near
    minimax simultaneously over a whole interval of the Besov scale; the size of this
    interval depends on the choice of mother wavelet. We know from a previous paper by
    the authors that traditional smoothing methods--kernels, splines, and orthogonal
    series estimates--even with optimal choices of the smoothing parameter, would be
    unable to perform in a near-minimax way over many spaces in the Besov scale.
    Examples of SureShrink are given. The advantages of the method are particularly
    evident when the underlying function has jump discontinuities on a smooth
    background.

    We describe efficient algorithms for projecting a vector onto the l1-ball. We
    present two methods for projection. The first performs exact projection in O(n)
    expected time, where n is the dimension of the space. The second works on vectors k
    of whose elements are perturbed outside the l1-ball, projecting in O(k log(n))
    time. This setting is especially useful for online learning in sparse feature
    spaces such as text categorization applications. We demonstrate the merits and
    effectiveness of our algorithms in numerous batch and online learning tasks. We
    show that variants of stochastic gradient projection methods augmented with our
    efficient projection procedures outperform interior point methods, which are
    considered state-of-the-art optimization techniques. We also show that in online
    settings gradient updates with l1 projections outperform the exponentiated gradient
    algorithm while obtaining models with high degrees of sparsity.

    The SLOPE estimator has the particularity of having null components (sparsity) and
    components that are equal in absolute value (clustering). The number of clusters

    The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection
    and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set
    of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large
    collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set
    for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS),
    a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional
    forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple
    modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of
    ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression
    coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a
    given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous
    methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise
    linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection
    explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and
    Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen
    as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation
    for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a
    Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of
    possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the
    paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of
    magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set
    of covariates.

    We investigate fast methods that allow to quickly eliminate variables (features) in
    supervised learning problems involving a convex loss function and a l₁-norm
    penalty, leading to a potentially substantial reduction in the number of variables
    prior to running the supervised learning algorithm. The methods are not heuristic:
    they only eliminate features that are \emph{guaranteed} to be absent after solving
    the learning problem. Our framework applies to a large class of problems, including
    support vector machine classification, logistic regression and least-squares. The
    complexity of the feature elimination step is negligible compared to the typical
    computational effort involved in the sparse supervised learning problem: it grows
    linearly with the number of features times the number of examples, with much better
    count if data is sparse. We apply our method to data sets arising in text
    classification and observe a dramatic reduction of the dimensionality, hence in
    computational effort required to solve the learning problem, especially when very
    sparse classifiers are sought. Our method allows to immediately extend the scope of
    existing algorithms, allowing us to run them on data sets of sizes that were out of
    their reach before.

    Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modeling,
    including nonparametric regression. Many approaches in use are stepwise selection
    procedures, which can be computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in
    the variable selection process. In this article, penalized likelihood approaches
    are proposed to handle these kinds of problems. The proposed methods select
    variables and estimate coefficients simultaneously. Hence they enable us to
    construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters. The proposed approaches
    are distinguished from others in that the penalty functions are symmetric,
    nonconcave on (0, \infty{}), and have singularities at the origin to produce sparse
    solutions. Furthermore, the penalty functions should be bounded by a constant to
    reduce bias and satisfy certain conditions to yield continuous solutions. A new
    algorithm is proposed for optimizing penalized likelihood functions. The proposed
    ideas are widely applicable. They are readily applied to a variety of parametric
    models such as generalized linear models and robust regression models. They can
    also be applied easily to nonparametric modeling by using wavelets and splines.
    Rates of convergence of the proposed penalized likelihood estimators are
    established. Furthermore, with proper choice of regularization parameters, we show
    that the proposed estimators perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable
    selection; namely, they work as well as if the correct submodel were known. Our
    simulation shows that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other
    variable selection techniques. Furthermore, the standard error formulas are tested
    to be accurate enough for practical applications.

    This paper studies ordered weighted L1 (OWL) norm regularization for sparse
    estimation problems with strongly correlated variables. We prove sufficient
    conditions for clustering based on the correlation/colinearity of variables using
    the OWL norm, of which the so-called OSCAR is a particular case. Our results extend
    previous ones for OSCAR in several ways: for the squared error loss, our conditions
    hold for the more general OWL norm and under weaker assumptions; we also establish
    clustering conditions for the absolute error loss, which is, as far as we know, a
    novel result. Furthermore, we characterize the statistical performance of OWL norm
    regularization for generative models in which certain clusters of regression
    variables are strongly (even perfectly) correlated, but variables in different
    clusters are uncorrelated. We show that if the true p-dimensional signal generating
    the data involves only s of the clusters, then O(s log p) samples suffice to
    accurately estimate the signal, regardless of the number of coefficients within the
    clusters. The estimation of s-sparse signals with completely independent variables
    requires just as many measurements. In other words, using the OWL we pay no price
    (in terms of the number of measurements) for the presence of strongly correlated
    variables.

    We consider ``one-at-a-time'' coordinate-wise descent algorithms for a class of
    convex optimization problems. An algorithm of this kind has been proposed for the
    L1-penalized regression (lasso) in the literature, but it seems to have been
    largely ignored. Indeed, it seems that coordinate-wise algorithms are not often
    used in convex optimization. We show that this algorithm is very competitive with
    the well-known LARS (or homotopy) procedure in large lasso problems, and that it
    can be applied to related methods such as the garotte and elastic net. It turns out
    that coordinate-wise descent does not work in the ``fused lasso,'' however, so we
    derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a
    standard convex optimizer. Finally, we generalize the procedure to the
    two-dimensional fused lasso, and demonstrate its performance on some image
    smoothing problems.

    We consider the problem of estimating sparse graphs by a lasso penalty applied to
    the inverse covariance matrix. Using a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso,
    we develop a simple algorithm--the graphical lasso--that is remarkably fast: It
    solves a 1000-node problem (\sim{}500000 parameters) in at most a minute and is
    30–4000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides a conceptual link
    between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by Meinshausen and
    B\"{u}hlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling data from
    proteomics.

    Bilevel optimization problems are receiving increasing attention in machine
    learning as they provide a natural framework for hyperparameter optimization and
    meta-learning. A key step to tackle these problems is the efficient computation of
    the gradient of the upper-level objective (hypergradient). In this work, we study
    stochastic approximation schemes for the hypergradient, which are important when
    the lower-level problem is empirical risk minimization on a large dataset. The
    method that we propose is a stochastic variant of the approximate implicit
    differentiation approach in (Pedregosa, 2016). We provide bounds for the mean
    square error of the hypergradient approximation, under the assumption that the
    lower-level problem is accessible only through a stochastic mapping which is a
    contraction in expectation. In particular, our main bound is agnostic to the choice
    of the two stochastic solvers employed by the procedure. We provide numerical
    experiments to support our theoretical analysis and to show the advantage of using
    stochastic hypergradients in practice.

    During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information
    technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as
    medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these
    data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and
    spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many
    of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
    terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common
    conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on
    concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of
    color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested
    in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from
    supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include
    neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the
    first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition
    features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models,
    random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for
    the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is
    also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple
    testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome
    Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent
    researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
    models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the
    statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal
    curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very
    successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many
    data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.

    Discover New Methods for Dealing with High-Dimensional Data  A sparse statistical
    model has only a small number of nonzero parameters or weights; therefore, it is
    much easier to estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical Learning with
    Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to
    help recover the underlying signal in a set of data.  Top experts in this rapidly
    evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple
    coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of
    \mathscr{l}1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines,
    cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review
    numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods
    for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently
    developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse
    multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with
    a survey of theoretical results for the lasso.  In this age of big data, the number
    of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than
    the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us
    to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big
    datasets. Data analysts, computer scientists, and theorists will appreciate this
    thorough and up-to-date treatment of sparse statistical modeling.

    In exciting recent work, Bertsimas, King and Mazumder (Ann. Statist. 44 (2016)
    813–852) showed that the classical best subset selection problem in regression
    modeling can be formulated as a mixed integer optimization (MIO) problem. Using
    recent advances in MIO algorithms, they demonstrated that best subset selection can
    now be solved at much larger problem sizes than what was thought possible in the
    statistics community. They presented empirical comparisons of best subset with
    other popular variable selection procedures, in particular, the lasso and forward
    stepwise selection. Surprisingly (to us), their simulations suggested that best
    subset consistently outperformed both methods in terms of prediction accuracy.
    Here, we present an expanded set of simulations to shed more light on these
    comparisons. The summary is roughly as follows: \textbullet{}neither best subset
    nor the lasso uniformly dominate the other, with best subset generally performing
    better in very high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regimes, and the lasso better in
    low SNR regimes; \textbullet{}for a large proportion of the settings considered,
    best subset and forward stepwise perform similarly, but in certain cases in the
    high SNR regime, best subset performs better; \textbullet{}forward stepwise and
    best subsets tend to yield sparser models (when tuned on a validation set),
    especially in the high SNR regime; \textbullet{}the relaxed lasso (actually, a
    simplified version of the original relaxed estimator defined in Meinshausen
    (Comput. Statist. Data Anal. 52 (2007) 374–393)) is the overall winner, performing
    just about as well as the lasso in low SNR scenarios, and nearly as well as best
    subset in high SNR scenarios.

    The problem of selecting the best subset or subsets of independent variables in a
    multiple linear regression analysis is two-fold. The first, and most important
    problem is the development of criterion for choosing between two contending
    subsets. Applying these criteria to all possible subsets, if the number of
    independent variables is large, may not be economically feasible and so the second
    problem is concerned with decreasing the computational effort. This paper is
    concerned with the second question using the Cp-statistic of Mallows as the basic
    criterion for comparing two regressions. A procedure is developed which will
    indicate 'good' regressions with a minimum of computation.

    State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many
    parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually
    exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and
    tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for
    solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements
    in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach
    constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target
    algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been
    limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single
    instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general
    algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and
    optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm
    configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for
    the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed
    integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded
    state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best
    configuration approach.

    Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to 1 regularization based methods for
    sparse signal reconstruction (e.g., basis pursuit denoising and compressed sensing)
    and feature selection (e.g., the Lasso algorithm) in signal processing, statistics,
    and related fields. These problems can be cast as 1-regularized least-squares
    programs (LSPs), which can be reformulated as convex quadratic programs, and then
    solved by several standard methods such as interior-point methods, at least for
    small and medium size problems. In this paper, we describe a specialized
    interior-point method for solving large-scale 1-regularized LSPs that uses the
    preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm to compute the search direction. The
    interior-point method can solve large sparse problems, with a million variables and
    observations, in a few tens of minutes on a PC. It can efficiently solve large
    dense problems, that arise in sparse signal recovery with orthogonal transforms, by
    exploiting fast algorithms for these transforms. The method is illustrated on a
    magnetic resonance imaging data set.

    Sorted L-One Penalized Estimator (SLOPE) is a relatively new convex optimization
    procedure for selecting predictors in high dimensional regression analyses. SLOPE
    extends LASSO by replacing the L1 penalty norm with a Sorted L1 norm, based on the
    non-increasing sequence of tuning parameters. This allows SLOPE to adapt to unknown
    sparsity and achieve an asymptotic minimax convergency rate under a wide range of
    high dimensional generalized linear models. Additionally, in the case when the
    design matrix is orthogonal, SLOPE with the sequence of tuning parameters
    \ensuremath{\lambda}BH corresponding to the sequence of decaying thresholds for the
    Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction provably controls the False
    Discovery Rate (FDR) in the multiple regression model. In this article we provide
    new asymptotic results on the properties of SLOPE when the elements of the design
    matrix are iid random variables from the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we
    provide conditions under which the asymptotic FDR of SLOPE based on the sequence
    \ensuremath{\lambda}BH converges to zero and the power converges to 1. We
    illustrate our theoretical asymptotic results with an extensive simulation study.
    We also provide precise formulas describing FDR of SLOPE under different loss
    functions, which sets the stage for future investigation on the model selection
    properties of SLOPE and its extensions.

    Extracting relevant features from data sets where the number of observations n is
    much smaller then the number of predictors p is a major challenge in modern
    statistics. Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE)--a generalization of the
    lasso---is a promising method within this setting. Current numerical procedures for
    SLOPE, however, lack the efficiency that respective tools for the lasso enjoy,
    particularly in the context of estimating a complete regularization path. A key
    component in the efficiency of the lasso is predictor screening rules: rules that
    allow  predictors to be discarded before estimating the model. This is the first
    paper to establish such a rule for SLOPE. We develop a screening rule for SLOPE by
    examining its subdifferential and show that this rule is a generalization of the
    strong rule for the lasso. Our rule is heuristic, which means that it may discard
    predictors erroneously. In our paper, however, we show that such situations are
    rare and easily safeguarded against by a simple check of the optimality conditions.
    Our numerical experiments show that the rule performs well in practice, leading to
    improvements by orders of magnitude for data in the \textbackslash (p
    \textbackslash gg n\textbackslash ) domain, as well as incurring no additional
    computational overhead when \$n {$>\$} p\$.

    The lasso is a popular method to induce shrinkage and sparsity in the solution
    vector (coefficients) of regression problems, particularly when there are many
    predictors relative to the number of observations. Solving the lasso in this
    high-dimensional setting can, however, be computationally demanding. Fortunately,
    this demand can be alleviated via the use of screening rules that discard
    predictors prior to fitting the model, leading to a reduced problem to be solved.
    In this paper, we present a new screening strategy: look-ahead screening. Our
    method uses safe screening rules to find a range of penalty values for which a
    given predictor cannot enter the model, thereby screening predictors along the
    remainder of the path. In experiments we show that these look-ahead screening rules
    outperform the active warm-start version of the Gap Safe rules.

    Predictor screening rules, which discard predictors from the design matrix before
    fitting a model, have had considerable impact on the speed with which
    l1-regularized regression problems, such as the lasso, can be solved. Current
    state-of-the-art screening rules, however, have difficulties in dealing with
    highly-correlated predictors, often becoming too conservative. In this paper, we
    present a new screening rule to deal with this issue: the Hessian Screening Rule.
    The rule uses second-order information from the model to provide more accurate
    screening as well as higher-quality warm starts. The proposed rule outperforms all
    studied alternatives on data sets with high correlation for both l1-regularized
    least-squares (the lasso) and logistic regression. It also performs best overall on
    the real data sets that we examine.

    The lasso is the most famous sparse regression and feature selection method. One
    reason for its popularity is the speed at which the underlying optimization problem
    can be solved. Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) is a generalization of the
    lasso with appealing statistical properties. In spite of this, the method has not
    yet reached widespread interest. A major reason for this is that current software
    packages that fit SLOPE rely on algorithms that perform poorly in high dimensions.
    To tackle this issue, we propose a new fast algorithm to solve the SLOPE
    optimization problem, which combines proximal gradient descent and proximal
    coordinate descent steps. We provide new results on the directional derivative of
    the SLOPE penalty and its related SLOPE thresholding operator, as well as provide
    convergence guarantees for our proposed solver. In extensive benchmarks on
    simulated and real data, we demonstrate our method's performance against a long
    list of competing algorithms.

    The regularization path of the Lasso can be shown to be piecewise linear, making it
    possible to ``follow'' and explicitly compute the entire path. We analyze in this
    paper this popular strategy, and prove that its worst case complexity is
    exponential in the number of variables. We then oppose this pessimistic result to
    an (optimistic) approximate analysis: We show \surd{}that an approximate path with
    at most O(1/ \ensuremath{\epsilon}) linear segments can always be obtained, where
    every point on the path is guaranteed to be optimal up to a relative
    \ensuremath{\epsilon}-duality gap. We complete our theoretical analysis with a
    practical algorithm to compute these approximate paths.

    Numerical validation is at the core of machine learning research as it allows to
    assess the actual impact of new methods, and to confirm the agreement between
    theory and practice. Yet, the rapid development of the field poses several
    challenges: researchers are confronted with a profusion of methods to compare,
    limited transparency and consensus on best practices, as well as tedious
    re-implementation work. As a result, validation is often very partial, which can
    lead to wrong conclusions that slow down the progress of research. We propose
    Benchopt, a collaborative framework to automate, reproduce and publish optimization
    benchmarks in machine learning across programming languages and hardware
    architectures. Benchopt simplifies benchmarking for the community by providing an
    off-the-shelf tool for running, sharing and extending experiments. To demonstrate
    its broad usability, we showcase benchmarks on three standard learning tasks:
    \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$-regularized logistic regression, Lasso, and ResNet18
    training for image classification. These benchmarks highlight key practical
    findings that give a more nuanced view of the state-of-the-art for these problems,
    showing that for practical evaluation, the devil is in the details. We hope that
    Benchopt will foster collaborative work in the community hence improving the
    reproducibility of research findings.

    Sorted \$L\_1\$ penalization estimator (SLOPE) is a regularization technique for
    sorted absolute coefficients in high-dimensional regression. By arbitrarily setting
    its regularization weights \$\textbackslash lambda\$ under the monotonicity
    constraint, SLOPE can have various feature selection and clustering properties. On
    weight tuning, the selected features and their clusters are very sensitive to the
    tuning parameters. Moreover, the exhaustive tracking of their changes is difficult
    using grid search methods. This study presents a solution path algorithm that
    provides the complete and exact path of solutions for SLOPE in fine-tuning
    regularization weights. A simple optimality condition for SLOPE is derived and used
    to specify the next splitting point of the solution path. This study also proposes
    a new design of a regularization sequence \$\textbackslash lambda\$ for feature
    clustering, which is called the quasi-spherical and octagonal shrinkage and
    clustering algorithm for regression (QS-OSCAR). QS-OSCAR is designed with a contour
    surface of the regularization terms most similar to a sphere. Among several
    regularization sequence designs, sparsity and clustering performance are compared
    through simulation studies. The numerical observations show that QS-OSCAR performs
    feature clustering more efficiently than other designs.

    The title Lasso has been suggested by Tibshirani (1996) as a colourful name for a
    technique of variable selection which requires the minimization of a sum of squares
    subject to an l1 bound \ensuremath{\kappa} on the solution. This forces zero
    components in the minimizing solution for small values of \ensuremath{\kappa}. Thus
    this bound can function as a selection parameter. This paper makes two
    contributions to computational problems associated with implementing the Lasso: (1)
    a compact descent method for solving the constrained problem for a particular value
    of \ensuremath{\kappa} is formulated, and (2) a homotopy method, in which the
    constraint bound \ensuremath{\kappa} becomes the homotopy parameter, is developed
    to completely describe the possible selection regimes. Both algorithms have a
    finite termination property. It is suggested that modified Gram-Schmidt
    orthogonalization applied to an augmented design matrix provides an effective basis
    for implementing the algorithms.

    presents readers with a coherent branch of nonlinear mathematical analysis that is
    especially suited to the study of optimization problems. Rockafellar's theory
    differs from classical analysis in that differentiability assumptions are replaced
    by convexity assumptions. The topics treated in this volume include: systems of
    inequalities, the minimum or maximum of a convex function over a convex set,
    Lagrange multipliers, minimax theorems and duality, as well as basic results about
    the structure of convex sets and the continuity and differentiability of convex
    functions and saddle- functions.  This book has firmly established a new and vital
    area not only for pure mathematics but also for applications to economics and
    engineering. A sound knowledge of linear algebra and introductory real analysis
    should provide readers with sufficient background for this book. There is also a
    guide for the reader who may be using the book as an introduction, indicating which
    parts are essential and which may be skipped on a first reading.

    For the problem of minimizing a lower semicontinuous proper convex function f on a
    Hilbert space, the proximal point algorithm in exact form generates a sequence
    \$\textbackslash\{ z\textasciicircum k \textbackslash\} \$ by taking
    \$z\textasciicircum\{k + 1\} \$ to be the minimizes of \$f(z) + (\{1 / \{2c\_k
    \}\})\textbackslash \vert{} \{z - z\textasciicircum k \} \textbackslash
    \vert{}\textasciicircum 2 \$, where \$c\_k {\$>\$} 0\$. This algorithm is of
    interest for several reasons, but especially because of its role in certain
    computational methods based on duality, such as the Hestenes-Powell method of
    multipliers in nonlinear programming. It is investigated here in a more general
    form where the requirement for exact minimization at each iteration is weakened,
    and the subdifferential \$\textbackslash partial f\$ is replaced by an arbitrary
    maximal monotone operator T. Convergence is established under several criteria
    amenable to implementation. The rate of convergence is shown to be ``typically''
    linear with an arbitrarily good modulus if \$c\_k \$ stays large enough, in fact
    superlinear if \$c\_k \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty \$. The case of \$T =
    \textbackslash partial f\$ is treated in extra detail. Application is also made to
    a related case corresponding to minimax problems.

    A simple model problem in exploration seismology requires that a depth-varying
    sound velocity distribution be estimated from reflected sound waves. For various
    physical reasons, these reflected signals or echoes have very small Fourier
    coefficients at both very high and very low frequencies. Nonetheless, both
    geophysical practice, based on heuristic considerations, and recent numerical
    evidence indicate that a spectrally complete estimate of the velocity distribution
    is often achievable. We prove a theorem to this effect, showing that ``sufficiently
    rough'' velocity distributions may be recovered from reflected waves under some
    restrictions, independently of the very low- or high-frequency content of the data.
    The main restriction is that the velocity depend only on a single (depth) variable;
    only in this case are sufficiently refined propagation-of-singularity results
    available. The proof is based on a novel variational principle, from which
    numerical algorithms have been derived. These algorithms have been implemented and
    used to estimate velocity distributions from both synthetic and field reflection
    seismograms.

    An important class of nonparametric signal processing methods entails forming a set
    of predictors from an overcomplete set of basis functions associated with a fast
    transform (e.g., wavelet packets). In these methods, the number of basis functions
    can far exceed the number of sample values in the signal, leading to an ill-posed
    prediction problem. The "basis pursuit" denoising method of Chen, Donoho, and
    Saunders regularizes the prediction problem by adding an l\textsubscript{1} penalty
    term on the coefficients for the basis functions. Use of an l\textsubscript{1}
    penalty instead of l\textsubscript{2} has significant benefits, including higher
    resolution of signals close in time/frequency and a more parsimonious
    representation. The l\textsubscript{1} penalty, however, poses a challenging
    optimization problem that was solved by Chen, Donoho and Saunders using a novel
    application of interior-point algorithms (IP). This article investigates an
    alternative optimization approach based on block coordinate relaxation (BCR) for
    sets of basis functions that are the finite union of sets of orthonormal basis
    functions (e.g., wavelet packets). We show that the BCR algorithm is globally
    convergent, and empirically, the BCR algorithm is faster than the IP algorithm for
    a variety of signal denoising problems.

    MOTIVATION: This paper gives a new and efficient algorithm for the sparse logistic
    regression problem. The proposed algorithm is based on the Gauss-Seidel method and
    is asymptotically convergent. It is simple and extremely easy to implement; it
    neither uses any sophisticated mathematical programming software nor needs any
    matrix operations. It can be applied to a variety of real-world problems like
    identifying marker genes and building a classifier in the context of cancer
    diagnosis using microarray data. RESULTS: The gene selection method suggested in
    this paper is demonstrated on two real-world data sets and the results were found
    to be consistent with the literature. AVAILABILITY: The implementation of this
    algorithm is available at the site http://guppy.mpe.nus.edu.sg/\textasciitilde

    The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of
    learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often
    a ``black art'' requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes
    brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that
    can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at
    hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian
    optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled
    as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the
    nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its
    hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can
    achieve expert-level performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account
    the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can
    leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that
    these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or
    surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent
    Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.

    We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the
    residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the
    coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint
    it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives
    interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of
    the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It
    produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of
    ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in
    adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite
    general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to
    generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.

    Summary. The lasso penalizes a least squares regression by the sum of the absolute
    values (L1-norm) of the coefficients. The form of this penalty encourages sparse
    solutions (with many coefficients equal to 0). We propose the `fused lasso', a
    generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in
    some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the coefficients
    and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients
    and also sparsity of their differences--i.e. local constancy of the coefficient
    profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much
    greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the `hinge' loss
    function that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods on
    examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.

    Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) uses approximate gradients estimated from subsets
    of the training data and updates the parameters in an online fashion. This learning
    framework is attractive because it often requires much less training time in
    practice than batch training algorithms. However, L1-regularization, which is
    becoming popular in natural language processing because of its ability to produce
    compact models, cannot be efficiently applied in SGD training, due to the large
    dimensions of feature vectors and the fluctuations of approximate gradients. We
    present a simple method to solve these problems by penalizing the weights according
    to cumulative values for L1 penalty. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method in
    three applications: text chunking, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech
    tagging. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can produce compact and
    accurate models much more quickly than a state-of-the-art quasiNewton method for
    L1-regularized loglinear models.

    performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate
    hyperplanes. They have been used in applications for many years, and their
    popularity continues to grow because of their usefulness in data analysis, machine
    learning, and other areas of current interest. This paper describes the
    fundamentals of the coordinate descent approach, together with variants and

    objectives. We pay particular attention to a certain problem structure that arises
    frequently in machine learning applications, showing that efficient implementations
    of accelerated coordinate descent algorithms are possible for problems of this
    type. We also present some parallel variants and discuss their convergence

    Imposition of a lasso penalty shrinks parameter estimates toward zero and performs
    continuous model selection. Lasso penalized regression is capable of handling
    linear regression problems where the number of predictors far exceeds the number of
    cases. This paper tests two exceptionally fast algorithms for estimating regression
    coefficients with a lasso penalty. The previously known \mathscr{l}2 algorithm is
    based on cyclic coordinate descent. Our new \mathscr{l}1 algorithm is based on
    greedy coordinate descent and Edgeworth's algorithm for ordinary \mathscr{l}1
    regression. Each algorithm relies on a tuning constant that can be chosen by
    cross-validation. In some regression problems it is natural to group parameters and
    penalize parameters group by group rather than separately. If the group penalty is
    proportional to the Euclidean norm of the parameters of the group, then it is
    possible to majorize the norm and reduce parameter estimation to \mathscr{l}2
    regression with a lasso penalty. Thus, the existing algorithm can be extended to
    novel settings. Each of the algorithms discussed is tested via either simulated or
    real data or both. The Appendix proves that a greedy form of the \mathscr{l}2
    algorithm converges to the minimum value of the objective function.

    Summary. We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables (factors) for
    accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem arises naturally in many
    practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most
    important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward
    elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the
    lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The
    lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed
    regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and
    propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor
    selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the
    traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We
    study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and
    real examples are used to illustrate the methods.

    the ability to cluster/group regression variables that are highly correlated. This

    to compute the Euclidean projection onto an OWL ball; the instantiation of the
    conditional gradient (CG, also known as Frank-Wolfe) algorithm for linear
    regression problems under OWL regularization; the instantiation of accelerated
    projected gradient algorithms for the same class of problems. Finally, a set of
    experiments give evidence that accelerated projected gradient algorithms are
    considerably faster than CG, for the class of problems considered.

    We propose MC+, a fast, continuous, nearly unbiased and accurate method of
    penalized variable selection in high-dimensional linear regression. The LASSO is
    fast and continuous, but biased. The bias of the LASSO may prevent consistent
    variable selection. Subset selection is unbiased but computationally costly. The
    MC+ has two elements: a minimax concave penalty (MCP) and a penalized linear
    unbiased selection (PLUS) algorithm. The MCP provides the convexity of the
    penalized loss in sparse regions to the greatest extent given certain thresholds
    for variable selection and unbiasedness. The PLUS computes multiple exact local
    minimizers of a possibly nonconvex penalized loss function in a certain main branch
    of the graph of critical points of the penalized loss. Its output is a continuous
    piecewise linear path encompassing from the origin for infinite penalty to a least
    squares solution for zero penalty. We prove that at a universal penalty level, the
    MC+ has high probability of matching the signs of the unknowns, and thus correct
    selection, without assuming the strong irrepresentable condition required by the
    LASSO. This selection consistency applies to the case of p\gg{}n, and is proved to
    hold for exactly the MC+ solution among possibly many local minimizers. We prove
    that the MC+ attains certain minimax convergence rates in probability for the
    estimation of regression coefficients in \mathscr{l}r balls. We use the SURE method
    to derive degrees of freedom and Cp-type risk estimates for general penalized LSE,
    including the LASSO and MC+ estimators, and prove their unbiasedness. Based on the
    estimated degrees of freedom, we propose an estimator of the noise level for proper
    choice of the penalty level. For full rank designs and general sub-quadratic
    penalties, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the continuity of the
    penalized LSE. Simulation results overwhelmingly support our claim of superior
    variable selection properties and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the
    proposed method.

    We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method.
    Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms
    the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the
    elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend
    to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when
    the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By
    contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p
    \gg{} n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net
    regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.

    The lasso is a popular technique for simultaneous estimation and variable
    selection. Lasso variable selection has been shown to be consistent under certain
    conditions. In this work we derive a necessary condition for the lasso variable
    selection to be consistent. Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the
    lasso is inconsistent for variable selection. We then propose a new version of the
    lasso, called the adaptive lasso, where adaptive weights are used for penalizing
    different coefficients in the \mathscr{l}1 penalty. We show that the adaptive lasso
    enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as if the true underlying
    model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to
    be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same
    efficient algorithm for solving the lasso. We also discuss the extension of the
    adaptive lasso in generalized linear models and show that the oracle properties
    still hold under mild regularity conditions. As a byproduct of our theory, the
    nonnegative garotte is shown to be consistent for variable selection.

    We generalize Newton-type methods for minimizing smooth functions to handle a sum
    of two convex functions: a smooth function and a nonsmooth function with a simple
    proximal mapping. We show that the resulting proximal Newton-type methods inherit
    the desirable convergence behavior of Newton-type methods for minimizing smooth
    functions, even when search directions are computed inexactly. Many popular methods
    tailored to problems arising in bioinformatics, signal processing, and statistical
    learning are special cases of proximal Newton-type methods, and our analysis yields
    new convergence results for some of these methods.

    This paper develops a fast method for solving linear SVMs with L2 loss function
    that is suited for large scale data mining tasks such as text classification. This
    is done by modifying the finite Newton method of Mangasarian in several ways.
    Experiments indicate that the method is much faster than decomposition methods such
    as SVMlight, SMO and BSVM (e.g., 4-100 fold), especially when the number of
    examples is large. The paper also suggests ways of extending the method to other
    loss functions such as the modified Huber's loss function and the L1 loss function,
    and also for solving ordinal regression.

    Although cancer classification has improved over the past 30 years, there has been
    no general approach for identifying new cancer classes (class discovery) or for
    assigning tumors to known classes (class prediction). Here, a generic approach to
    cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is
    described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery
    procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia
    (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these
    classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class
    of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer
    classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general
    strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer,
    independent of previous biological knowledge.

    Proposed by Tibshirani, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
    estimates a vector of regression coefficients by minimizing the residual sum of
    squares subject to a constraint on the l\textsuperscript{1}-norm of the coefficient
    vector. The LASSO estimator typically has one or more zero elements and thus shares
    characteristics of both shrinkage estimation and variable selection. In this
    article we treat the LASSO as a convex programming problem and derive its dual.
    Consideration of the primal and dual problems together leads to important new
    insights into the characteristics of the LASSO estimator and to an improved method
    for estimating its covariance matrix. Using these results we also develop an
    efficient algorithm for computing LASSO estimates which is usable even in cases
    where the number of regressors exceeds the number of observations. An S-Plus
    library based on this algorithm is available from StatLib.

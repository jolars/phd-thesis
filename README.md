# Optimization and Algorithms in Sparse Regression

This is my PhD thesis in statistics, which I am set to defend June 28. This repository contains the source files necessary to compile a pdf version of the thesis, as well as scripts for most of the figures and results in the introduction.

The source code was originally based on a template by Daniel Michalik, but has been modified by me in several ways, for instance to use standard book margins, open-source fonts, and a different paper numbering scheme.
